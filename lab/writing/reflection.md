# CMPSC 100: Week 7 reflection

This week, we learned about:

* "states"
* objects which we can:
  * do things _to_
  * do things _with_
* `import`ing modules, namely:
  * `json`
  * `random`
* extended problem-solving

## For this week's lab, you had to write one `import`. Describe what it was any why we used it.

`TODO`

## In this work, you used some methods of an object you'd never seen before. How did using these methods leverage knowledge you already had? Where did they depart?

`TODO`

## From this work, describe how you understand "statefulness" or, the idea that objects have a persistent state.

`TODO`

## In the code block below (the area between the "tick" characters), paste a bit of the conversation you had with Robby. What was it like to talk to the chatbot?

```
TELL ROBBY STUFF
```

`TODO`

## It's possible that you made `Robby` sad. They could have also ended your conversation happy. Did this provoke any kind of response? Why or why not?
