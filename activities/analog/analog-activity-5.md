# Analog Activity 5: Modules and Objects

This week begins one of the most important concepts underlying efficient and flexible programming: using "objects" to transform data or achieve outcomes in a predictable way.

## Setup

Duration: ~10 minutes

You should ask questions during the "Setup" phase.

* The instructor will choose participants from your team to become `neutral representatives`, who:
  * swears not to help your team in the following task
  * can't really help all that much anyway tho

This player should report to the professor. The remainder of the team are going to go hunting for secret treasure.

The instructor will run a demonstration round to both show how this game works _and_ how the `neutral representatives` will work.

* Each non-neutral player will receive a map
  * This is a treasure map
* You will traverse the classroom sea to determine the best route to find a treasure
  * Of course, that treasure is points
  * You guessed that already

## Playing the game

Duration: 10 minutes per round (2 rounds)

* Players cannot choose "Treasure" as a destination
* Players must choose either `Route A` or `Route B` at a given island
  * The `neutral representative` "governing" the island will give players their next destination
* Players must keep track of their routes via single-letter designation:
  * e.g. `ABAAB...`
* The first player to reach the island from a group will be awarded points according to the following table:

|Place |Points |
|:-----|:------|
|1     |10     |
|2     |5      |
|3     |3      |

## Additional reminders and guidelines

* You must complete the activity [reflection](writing/reflection.md) to receive full credit.

## Debrief

Duration: ~15 minutes

The course will reconvene as a whole to discuss conclusions drawn or arising from the activity.
